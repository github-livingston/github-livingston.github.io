LaGriT Applications
-------------------

Visit [meshing.lanl.gov](https://meshing.lanl.gov/proj/index.md) for
examples of mesh applications in geological applications: porous flow,
hydrology, carbon dioxide sequestration, oil and gas, crustal deformation, hydrothermal systems,
and more. The following are graphics and software output formats used
with LaGriT and may be obtained from their respective sources.
