* input.cylrot use rotateln and trans to move cylinder

* create a cylinder centered around x=.5,z=.5, radius = .1

* the cylinder is aligned parallel to the y-axis.

* inside a box of width =2 , length=2 ,1

* the regions are air for the cylinder - solid outside the cyl.

* points are spread by surrounding the whole object with

* a cylinder shell of points and then creating rays between

* these points and the major axis of the cylinder. Points

* are distributed along these rays inside the cylindrical region.

* a background rectangular grid of points is spread outside the

* cylinder.

* the rz command always distributes points with the z-axis as

* the axis of symmetry

* use the rotateln and trans commands to move the point

* distribution after it is created.
