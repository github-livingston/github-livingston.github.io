 **BOUNDARY**

  The boundary routine operates on the current mesh object. For the
  nodes lying on the specified surface(s), it sets the specified node
  based attribute to the specified value. Optionally boundary will
  call the user supplied subroutine set\_user\_bounds [(see IV.
  e.8)](miscell.md)

 **FORMAT:**

  **boundary/dirichlet**/attr\_name/[valueidentifier]/surface\_list

  where:

   --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
   **dirichlet**   is currently unused but must be specified 
   attr\_name      is the name of the attribute to be set 
   value           is a constant, and is the value to which the attribute is set
   identifier      is a character string that will be passed to
                   subroutine set\_user\_bounds 
   --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

   surface\_list is one of:
  
       **-all-** (all boundary nodes)

       surface\_name**/inclusive** (all bndry nodes on surface)

       surface\_name**/exclusive** (all bndry nodes ONLY on
       surface)

       surface\_name/ (same as exclusive)

       surface\_name1/surface\_name2**/inclusive**

       (all bndry nodes on the union of the surfaces)

       surface\_name1/surface\_name2**/exclusive** (default)

       (all bndry nodes ONLY on the intersection of the
       surfaces)

       surface\_name1/surface\_name2/ surface\_name3/.... (same
       as exclusive)

 

 **EXAMPLES:**

  **boundary** **/dirichlet**/vd\_v/7.0**/-all-**/

  sets the attribute vd\_v for all boundary nodes to be 7.0

  **boundary** **/dirichlet**/vi\_s/8.0/pbot/

  **boundary** **/dirichlet**/vd\_v/9.0/pbot**/inclusive**/

  sets the attribute vd\_v for the nodes that are on the surface pbot
  to be 9.0

  **boundary** **/dirichlet**/vd\_s/13.0/pfrt

  sets the attribute vd\_s for the nodes that are on the union of the
  surfaces pfrt and prgt to 13.0

  **boundary** **/dirichlet**/vi\_t/12.0/prgt/

  **boundary** **/dirichlet**/bconds/top\_plane/s1,s2,s3/

  will pass the set of nodes on the intersection of surfaces s1,s2 and
  s3 along with the string top-plane to subroutine set\_user\_bounds.
