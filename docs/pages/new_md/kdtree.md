 **KDTREE **

  **KDTRE**E uses the elements of the current mesh object to produce a
  k-D tree that is stored in the attributes LINKT and SBOX that are
  appended to the mesh object.  Leaf nodes in LINKT each contain
  exactly one element index.   Because of the possibility of triangle
  overlap, **KDTREE** also produces an array SBOX which gives 'safety
  boxes'.  For each node in the k-D tree, there is a corresponding
  safety box which is just big enough to contain all the triangles 
  "under" the node.  The attributes LINKT and SBOX are used by the
  subroutine:  RETRIEVE\_WITHIN\_EPS.  RETRIEVE\_WITHIN\_EPS finds all
  elements with epsilon of the query point (xq,yq,zq). What is
  actually returned is a small subset of leaves  (i.e., elements) that
  feasibly could be within epsilon of the query point.  The user must
  then do exact geometric tests on this small subset to actually
  determine which elements are a distance epsilon from the query
  point.

   
  subroutine retrieve\_within\_eps(xq,yq,zq,linkt,sbox,
  eps,nefound,iefound,ierr)

    ------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
    xq, yq, zq    coordinates of query point
    linkt, sbox   mesh object KDTREE attributes created by the KDTREE command
    eps           search epsilon
    nefound       number of elements found
    iefound       array of elements found
    ierr          error flag   (0 = no error)
    ------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
 
   

  The attributes LINKT and SBOX may also be used by the subroutine:
  NEARESTPOINT.  NEARESTPOINT uses the k-D tree structure for a
  triangular surface mesh object  (generated by KDTREE) to accelerate
  finding the nearest point on the surface to the given query point
  (xq,yq,zq).  What is actually returned is a small subset of leaves
  (i.e., triangles) that feasibly could contain the nearest point. 
  The user must then do exact geometric tests on this small subset to
  determine points of intersection.

   

   subroutine nearestpoint(xq,yq,zq,xic,yic,zic,itet,xs,ys,zs,
  linkt,sbox,eps,distpossleaf,mtfound,itfound,ierr)

   
    -------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    xq, yq, zq     coordinates of query point
    xic,yic,zic    arrays of coordinates of nodes in the surface mesh object
    itet           array containing trianged-node relationship for surface mesh object.
    xs,ys,zs       coordinates of previous retrieved "nearestpoint".  If there is no previous query, set these to a very large value
    linkt, sbox    mesh object.  KDTREE attributes created by the KDTREE command
    distpossleaf   work array of length = number of triangles in the surface mesh.
    mtfound        number of triangles found
    itfound        array of triangle (element number) found
    ierr           error flag
