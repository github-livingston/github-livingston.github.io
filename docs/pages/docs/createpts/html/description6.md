 Example : creatpts in a spherical geometry using shells as region
 boundaries

  The objective is to create a spherical mesh using the
  **createpts/sphere** command.
  A spherical geometry is defined containing three regions, each
  defined as the region between two

  spherical shells. The **createpts/sphere/itype=2** command is used
  to create a point distribution between

  spherical shells for all diamonds of the defining icosahedron. The
  output consists of one gmv file.
