 **SURFPTS**

  Generates points on boundary surfaces previously defined by the
  surface or region command. The variable itype can be
  **surface** or **region** and iname is the name of the surface or
  region. The points are generated by shooting rays through a user
  specified set of points from an origin point, line or plane and
  finding the surface intersection of each ray. The point location for
  a region is determined by iregpt and can be on the **inside**,
  **outside** or **both** surfaces.

 **FORMAT:**

  **surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/geom/ray\_origin

  **surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt**/pset,get,setname**/geom/ray\_origin

  Where ifirst,ilast,istride or **pset,get**,setname define the set of
  points to shoot rays through. SPECIFICALLY FOR ALLOWABLE GEOMETRY
  TYPES:

  **surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride**/xyz**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/x3,y3,z3

  Where points 1, 2, 3 define the plane to shoot rays from that are
  normal to the plane.

  **surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/

  **rtz**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2 /

  Where points 1, 2, define the line to shoot rays from that are
  perpendicular to the line.

  **surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/

  **rtp**/xcen,ycen,zcen/

  **surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/ **points**
  /iffirst,iflast,ifstride/

  Where ifirst,ilast,istride define a set of points to shoot rays
  from.
