 RESETPTS

  Reset node values.
 
  If option is parent (default) the parent child flags are reset.
  All child points are eliminated and the connectivity list is
  corrected to reference only the parent points.
 
  If option is itp the itp1 array is reset to indicate whether
  each node is in the interior (0), on an interior interface (2), on a
  reflected boundary (10), or on a reflected interface boundary (12) .
  Resetting itp would be used if nodes were removed (such as with
  rmmat) leaving new boundaries
 
  If option is ell\_color then node color (imt) is set based
  on element color(itetclr).  There are three behaviors possible
  depending on whether 0, 1 or 3 arguments are specified.
 
  -   If no arguments are given, then, loop through all itetclr
      values in ascending order, and reset node imt to element
      colors, (itetclr). Note that if parent/child nodes do not
      exist, then an interface node will have its imt value set to
      the largest value of itetclr of all elements that contain
      this node.
  -   If three arguments are given, then these 3 arguments are
      interpreted as itetclr\_min, itetclr\_max, itetclr\_stride. 
      Node colors are reset only for nodes in elements that fall in
      the subset selected.  See examples given below.
  -   If one argument is given, this argument is an node imt value
      and only nodes with node color (imt ) equal to this value
      will be set to the element color (itetclr).  This option
      loops through each node of each element and if the node color
      (imt) is equal to the user specified value
      (integer\_node\_color) then it is changed to the element color
      (itetclr). This will introduce a bias since the nodes are
      modified in the order of the element numbering. To give some
      control over the bias the user can specify a negative value for
      integer\_node\_color. In that case, the element loop goes from
      largest to smallest element number.

FORMAT:

**resetpts**   

remove child points

**resetpts**/parent   

remove child points

**resetpts**/itp

set node type (itp) from connectivity of mesh

**resetpts**/cell\_color/

set all node colors (imt) from element colors(itetclr)

**resetpts**/cell\_color/istart,iend,istride     

set all node colors (imt) from element colors(itetclr)

**resetpts**/cell\_color/ integer\_node\_color   

reset node imt for nodes with imt currently = integer\_node\_color from the itetclr of an element that contains the node

EXAMPLES:

    resetpts/itp  

set node type from connectivity of mesh

    resetpts/cell\_color/1   

replace node color for nodes that currently have imt value of 1 by the cell color of an element containing the node; this is done by looping through all the elements in cell color order, so that the value of imt will be the largest itetclr of the set of elements containing this node.

    resetpts/cell\_color/  

loop through all element colors and reset all node imt values

    resetpts/cell\_color/-1  

replace node color for nodes that currently have imt value of 1 by the cell color of an element containing the node; this is done by looping through all the elements in desending cell color order, so that the value of imt will be the smallest itetclr of the set of elements containing this node.

    resetpts/cell\_color/1,0,0   

loop through all element colors and reset all node imt values (same as previous example)

    resetpts/cell\_color/1,3,1   

loop through colors from itetclr=1 to itetclr=3

    resetpts/cell\_color/3,1,-1  

loop through colors from itetclr=3 to itetclr=1
