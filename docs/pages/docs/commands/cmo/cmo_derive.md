**derive**/ mo\_name/master\_mo/
mo\_name is type character, required.

master\_mo is type character, default is -cmo-

Uses Mesh Object, master\_mo, as the template for deriving Mesh Object,
mo\_name. Mesh Object, mo\_name, will be an image of master\_mo but will
contain no data. The output Mesh Object, mo\_name, will become the
Current Mesh Object. If mo\_name is the same as master\_mo nothing
happens. If mo\_name exists it is over written.
