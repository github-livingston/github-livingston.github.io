# LaGriT GitHub development website #
Repo for rapid testing and implementation of GitHub.io website features.  
Will be merged into main LaGriT repo upon completion.  
Changes to individual pages (i.e., `triangulate`) should still be done on the main repo. Edits to styles, fonts, and overall styles are done here.
