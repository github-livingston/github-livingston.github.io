 **geometry/create**

  **geometry/create** /geom\_name
  Initialize a geometry called geom\_name. Change the name of the
  current geometry to geom\_name. Save all values associated with the
  previous geometry.  To associate this geometry with a mesh object
  use the [cmo/geometry](commands/cmo/cmo_geom.md) command.  See
  III.E for a discussion of geometry.

 **EXAMPLES:**

  **geometry/create**/new\_geom/
