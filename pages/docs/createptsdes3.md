    createpts/rtp/2,6,30/0,0,0/1,,360/1,1,1

Argument | Description
---------- | ---
rtp |      specifies sperical coordinates
2,6,30 |   create 2 points in the r direction, create 6 points in the t direction, create 30 points in the z direction
0,0,0   |   rmin = 0, tmin = 0, zmin = 0
1,,360 |  radius from 0 to 1, angle in the xy-plane is  degrees, angle in the zy-plane is 360 degrees
1,0,1   |   rmins and rmaxs are used as cell vertices, tmins and tmaxs are used as cell vertices, zmins and zmaxs are used as cell vertices
