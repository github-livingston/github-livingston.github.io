 **CREATEPTS/BRICK**

Builds a set nodes (logically rectangular) and create finite element
hexahedral connectivity. This command is similar to the rz command
format except here we have symmetry flags to input. A second format
specifies that a mesh be created and connected.

**xyz** specifies Cartesian coordinates.

**rtz** specifies cylindrical coordinates.

**rtp** specifies spherical coordinates.

ni,nj,nk number of points to be created in each direction.

xmin,ymin,zmin minimums for coordinates.

xmax,ymax,zmax maximums for coordinates.

iiz,ijz,ikz  if =0 then mins and maxs are used as cell centers

if =1 then mins and maxs are used as cell vertices

iirat,ijrat,ikrat ratio zoning switches (0=off,1=on)

xrz,yrz,zrz ratio zoning value - distance is multiplied by the value for
each subsequent point.

name name of pset containing starting point number

isym,jsym,ksym symmetry flags - not documented

**FORMAT:**

reatepts/brick** **/xyz** **rtz** **rtp**/ni,nj,nk/xmin,ymin,zmin/xmax,ymax,zmax/

iiz,ijz,ikz/[iirat,ijrat,ikrat/xrz,yrz,zrz/isym,jsym,ksym]

or

reatepts/brick/xyzrtzrtp**/ni,nj,nk**/pset,get,**name/onnect**/

Use this option (for example, with **quadxyz)** to create finite element
hexahedral connectivity on a logically rectangular set of nodes created
via another method..

**EXAMPLES:**

reatepts/brick/xyz**/3,2,3/0.,0.,0./1.,1.,1./1,1,1

creates a set of hex points (3x2x3 nodes) and elements (2x1x2 cells) in
the unit cube. The onnect** option should not be used in this case
because the connectivity is created.

Create a 3D set of nodes using **quadxyz** and then create hex
connectivity with the reatepts** command:

cmo/create/cmohex / / / hex

**quadxyz**/5,7,5/0.,0.,0./1.,0.,0./1.5,0.5,2.0/.5,.2,2.5/

-1.,1.5,0./2.0,0.,0.0/2.1,1.9,2.4/-0.2,1.8,2.3/

reatepts/brick/xyz**/5,7,5/1,0,0/connect

 

Create a 2D set of nodes using quadxy and then create quad connectivity
with the creatpts command:

cmo/create/cmoquad/ / / quad

quadxy/ 11, 11 / 0. 0. 0. / 1. 0. 0. / 1. 1. 0. / 0. 1. 0.

reatepts**/brick/xyz/11,11,1/1 0 0 / connect
