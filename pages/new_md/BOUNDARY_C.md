 **BOUNDARY\_COMPONENTS**

  The boundary\_components  routine adds the attribute "numbnd" to the
  current cmo to which is written the number of outside boundaries
  based on itp values  In addition it prints out the number of
  connected boundary components and a representative vertex from each
  boundary component.  The itp array may need to be updated first,
  this can be done with the command **resetpts/itp.**

 **FORMAT:**

  **boundary\_components**
